CHANGELOG
=========

1.0.0
-----

This is a backwards incompatible feature and bugfix release.

  * Renamed all classes and defines from 'gentoo' to 'portage'
  * Bugfixes for the package_use parsedfile provider
  * Metadata corrections to add concat as a dependency
  * Site specific files removed
  * Removed legacy defined types for package.* entries
  * Removed unusable localegen and category defined types

Major thanks to Theo Chatzimichos testing the module and reporting/fixing
bugs.
